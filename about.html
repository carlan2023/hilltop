      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p>
        Empowering and transforming the most vulnerable and most unfortunate
        HIV/AIDS OVCs through the provision of high quality education for better
        resource exploitation, management and control for improved quality of
        lives of these OVCs”.
      </p>
      <h1>Our Vision</h1>
      <p>
        A Community with people living with HIV/AIDS and OVCs who are
        self-reliant and able to survive without always taking due recourse to
        charity

            We are working within our community to improve their Livelihoods
            through affordable education
          </h1>
          <p>
            The schools program was adopted a development strategy in order to
            restore hope and solace in the broken hearts of the HIV/AIDS
            orphaned and vulnerable children (OVCs) living under difficult
            circumstances. It is basically intended for (1) - Child survival and
            (2) - Child development. We serve the most unfortunate and less
            privileged children in both school sections and they  include among
            others the HIV/AIDS orphaned and other vulnerable children in the
            community. We therefore intend to encourage families, communities
            and external parties to treat all orphans and other vulnerable
            children with respect insuring that they are not treated as helpless
            victims but as actors in their own rights. They should be entitled
            to express their own views, actively participate in decision making
            process and be actively involved in matters that relate to them. We
            are inspired at having a community with vulnerable groups of people
            who are self-reliant, able to survive, sustain themselves, advocate,
            attain and defend their individual rights without always taking due
            recourse to charity. We see this as more cohesive arm in the
            creation of a world with better opportunities, liberties and rights
            for all. With increased literacy levels among the most unfortunate
            HIV/AIDS Orphaned and Vulnerable Children (OVCs), better
            opportunities and liberties are created on to them for enhancement
            of greater social, economic and political equality and rights and
            this obviously help move the world towards a more compassionate and
            socially just world. These children too like other children need
            love, care, support, food, education and other basic necessities of
            life. Please, let us work together in partnership and contribute in
            order to improve the situation under which these children live,
            study, grow and survive.
