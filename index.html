        <h1>Welcome to Kaboyo Education Centre</h1>
        <p>
          The Centre was established to provide education opportunity to
          children from disadvantaged homes and <br />
          underserved Communities. the project was started as a development
          strategy in order to restore hope and solace in the broken hearts of
          HIV/AIDS orphaned and vulnerable children (OVCs) living under
          difficult circumstances. <br />
          The project is basically intended for (1) -Child Survival and (2) -
          Child development. We have two schools namely; St. Henry's High School
          Kaboyo for students of ages 12 - 18 seeking Secondary Education, and
          Hilltop Foundation Nursery and Primary School for pupils of ages
          between 2 to 12 years old seeking primary education.

            Hilltop Foundation Nursery and Primary School Kaboyo is intended for
            children of ages Between 2 - 12 years old. We intend to encourage
            families, communities and external parties to treat all orphans and
            other vulnerable children with respect insuring that they are not
            treated as helpless victims but as actors in their own rights. They
            should be entitled to express their own views, actively participate
            in decision making process and be actively involved in matters that
            relate to them. <br />

            The school aims to reduce illiteracy levels among HIV/AIDS OVCs. We
            try to provide care, support, canceling and guidance but our
            services are limited by inadequate infrastructure, facilities,
            resources and finances. These children like other children need
            love, guidance, care and support in terms of education, personal
            scholastic materials, uniform, breakfast, lunch, hygiene education,
            first aid treatment, medicine, transport and upkeep. <br />

          <h3>Sponsor A child</h3>
          <p>
            We invite you to join our Sponsor a Child program, a meaningful way
            to support the education and future of a deserving student. Your
            generous donation will provide essential financial assistance,
            covering tuition, school supplies, and other educational needs for
            children who would otherwise be unable to afford these necessities.
            By sponsoring a child, you are not only giving them access to
            quality education but also empowering them to achieve their dreams
            and break the cycle of poverty. Every contribution, no matter the
            size, makes a significant impact. Together, we can create a brighter
            future for these children and their communities. Learn more about
            how you can get involved and make a lasting difference today.
