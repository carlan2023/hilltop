      <h1>WHAT WE DO</h1>
      <p>
        The Education Centre was established in 1999 as St. Henry's High School
        Kaboyo, but we have later grown to add a kindergarten and nursey school
        for elementary education. <br />
        St. Henry's High School Kaboyo Education project for the orphaned and
        vulnerable children.  There are two School sections at the Centre
        namely; 1- Hilltop Foundation nursery and Primary School Kaboyo for
        pupils of ages between 2 - 12 years old 2- St. Henry’s high School
        Kaboyo for Children of ages between 12 - 22 years old

          <h3>Elemenatary School education</h3>
          <p>
            That's; Hilltop Foundation nursery and Primary School Kaboyo with
            children of ages Between 2 - 12 years old and St. Henry's High
            School Kaboyo with children of ages Between 12 - 18 years old. The
            program was adopted a development strategy in order to restore hope
            and solace in the broken hearts of the HIV/AIDS orphaned and
            vulnerable children (OVCs) living under difficult circumstances. It
            is basically intended for (1) - Child survival and (2) - Child
            development. We intend to encourage families, communities and
            external parties to treat all orphans and other vulnerable children
            with respect insuring that they are not treated as helpless victims
            but as actors in their own rights. They should be entitled to
            express their own views, actively participate in decision making
            process and be actively involved in matters that relate to them.

          <h3>Secondary School Education</h3>
          <p>
            St. Henry’s High School Kaboyo was started as a development strategy
            in order to restore hope and solace in the broken hearts of the
            HIV/AIDS orphaned and vulnerable children (OVCs) living under
            difficult circumstances. The school has 236 students majority of
            which are OVCs. Their age range is between 12 – 22 years. The school
            struggles to reduce illiteracy levels among these HIV/AIDS OVCs. It
            struggles to provide care, support, canceling and guidance but our
            services are limited by inadequate infrastructure, facilities,
            resources and finances. These children like other children need
            love, guidance, care and support in terms of education, personal
            scholastic materials, uniform, breakfast, lunch, hygiene education,
            first aid treatment, medicine, transport and upkeep.

          <h3>Sponsor A child</h3>
          <p>
            We invite you to join our Sponsor a Child program, a meaningful way
            to support the education and future of a deserving student. Your
            generous donation will provide essential financial assistance,
            covering tuition, school supplies, and other educational needs for
            children who would otherwise be unable to afford these necessities.
            By sponsoring a child, you are not only giving them access to
            quality education but also empowering them to achieve their dreams
            and break the cycle of poverty. Every contribution, no matter the
            size, makes a significant impact. Together, we can create a brighter
            future for these children and their communities. Learn more about
